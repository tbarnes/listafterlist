# listafterlist
Simple List Management Tool originally for Listafterlist.com before moving to basic WP instance.

## Notes
This is a basic PHP CRUD app with simple user management and basic CMS capabilities. It assumes you're building a list app and want members to contribute. Things like password management, etc are handled, but not super securely. If you're going to build a serious production-level app out of this, you'll want to update the shortcuts I took.
